## Program Walkthrough 
* Our program takes in two name inputs (Your name, and your mothers name) and stores them into seperate variables. 
* The uppercase of each name is then stroed into another variable for each name
* Two statments are printed out 
* The first print statment tells the user the two names they typed in
* The second print statment prints out the names again but capitalized
