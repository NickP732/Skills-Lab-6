# Skills-Lab-6

## What our program does
* Our program takes in two name inputs (Your name, and your mothers name) and stores them into seperate variables. 
* The uppercase of each name is then stored into another variable for each name
* Two statments are printed out 
* The first print statment tells the user the two names they typed in
* The second print statment prints out the names again but capitalized

## How to use our program
* Installation: 
  * Navigate to github.com/NickP732/Skills-Lab-6/ and download the file named program.py
* Use:
  * Open the command-line / terminal on your computer
  * Navigate to the directory in which you downloaded program.py
  * Depending on the version of python installed on your machine, type either python program.py or python3 program.py, and press enter.
  * Follow the instructions that appear in the terminal / command-line window and follow documentation found at github.com/NickP732/Skills-Lab-6/ in order to properly       use the downloaded program.
## How to contribute
* Due to financial restraints we are unable to reach the full potential of our code with only in-house developers. That's why we need you, the user to come up with new     and exciting ways to interpret and modify our program.
* Given its simple nature, there are countless ways to fork our code, whether it be modifying the existing code to create another simple program, or to incorporate our     code as part of a much larger project. This can be done by copy pasting the code from the program.py file into an existing file, or by opening program.py in a text       editor and modifying the file itself. 
* To submit pull requests, open the github repo and click the "Create pull request" button. From here, we can choose to either merge your contributions or reject them.
